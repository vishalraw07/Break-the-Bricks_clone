# Break-the-Bricks_clone
The player has to destroy all the bricks with the balls.

Gameplay:
The objective of "Break the Brick" is straightforward: use a paddle and ball to break a wall of bricks. Players control the paddle's horizontal movement, bouncing the ball off it to strike and destroy the bricks. The primary challenge lies in aiming the ball accurately and anticipating its trajectory as it bounces off the walls and various power-ups.

The Basics:
Paddle: A horizontal bar that moves left and right at the bottom of the screen, controlled by the player.
Ball: A small, bouncing object that ricochets around the screen, breaking bricks on contact.
Bricks: Arranged in different patterns and colors, each brick has a certain number of hits required to destroy it.

Implemented Concepts:
1. Singleton class (for level & sound manager)
2. Particle effects & music
3. Raycasting for destroyer block
